      <!-- Description [p] -->
      <p class="desc">
        Roti is a basic, everyday bread, but making it takes a lot of skill. The
        dough is kneaded with just enough water to bring it together and keep it
        soft and pliable. And though it’s not yeasted, a ball of well-mixed and
        -rested dough will be supple and almost spongy, as if it were. Cooks who
        are used to making roti at home can roll out thin, round disks that puff
        up as if by magic. But the real magic of roti is how a few of them can
        turn anything — a little kheema, or a few spoonfuls of aloo masala —
        into a satisfying meal.

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
          <li>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            In a large bowl, mix the flour, oil and salt with ¾ cup lukewarm
            water. Knead directly in the bowl until smooth, about 5 minutes. If
            the dough starts to feel dry, add more water as needed, ½ tablespoon
            at a time. Divide the dough into 12 even balls, placing each ball
            back in the bowl. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap. Let rest
            in a warm place for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. The dough
            should be soft and spongy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            Lightly dust your work surface with flour and pat a ball into a
            thick disk. Use a rolling pin to evenly roll it into a thin,
            5-inch-wide disk, flipping and flouring as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Put the disk in the
            hot pan. When bubbles start to form and the roti starts to turn
            white, about 30 seconds, flip it over to cook the other side. It
            should be puffy in places and freckled brown. If you want to fully
            puff the roti, use tongs to gently place it directly on a low gas
            flame for about 2 to 3 seconds, then quickly remove it. Use the back
            of a spoon to lightly coat one side of the roti with ghee, if you
            like, or leave plain, then tuck into a clean dishcloth to keep warm.
            Repeat with the remaining dough.
